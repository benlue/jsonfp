0.0.6
=====
+ A lot more operators are added and built-in operators are grouped into 'arithmetic', 'arrays', 'collections' and 'comparators' modules.
+ An operator can specify if JSON-FP should evaluate its option or not. With such a specification, JSON-FP developers could omit the 'def' operator and make JSON-FP more succint.

0.0.5
=====
+ Added promise support. With the new feature, a JSON-FP program can intake promised input. Also, if you add customized JSON-FP operators (transformations) whose output is a promise, JSON-FP can handle them properly.

0.0.4
=====
+ cleared up syntax (please check README for details)
+ supported alpha-conversion
+ more operators are supported (add, def, convert, eval, pluck, reduce).

0.0.3
