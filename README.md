JSON-fp
=======

In a decentralized computing environment, it will be a common practice to pass programming codes to various machines to execute (and then gather the results). However, how can machines of various configurations understand each other? Also, the "moving code, least moving data" policy prefers functional programming to imperative programming.

Those questions/issues lead to the idea of doing functional programming in JSON. If programs can be coded in JSON, they will be easy to be shipped around and understood by machines of vaious settings. Combining JSON and functional programming also makes security issues easier to track or manage. 

JSON-fp is part of an attempt to make data freely and easily accessed, distributed, annotated, meshed, even re-emerged with new values. To achieve that, it's important to be able to ship codes to where data reside, and that's what JSON-fp is trying to achieve.

** Note**: The current implementation is in the very early stage. In fact, it's nothing more than making the test cases work. The code was used to show case the idea. Any comments/feedback are welcome.
